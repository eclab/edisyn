<h1>Kawai K4</h1> 
<h2>Effect Patch Editor</h2>

<p>This editor will work with the <b>Kawai K4</b> and the <b>Kawai K4r</b>.

<br><br><h3>Communicating with Edisyn</h3>

Set your K4 to receive Program Changes (RCV PGM) and Exclusive (RCV EXCL).  See pages 79 and 80 of the manual.  You'll also probably want your send channel and receive channel to be the same.  I wouldn't set the receive channel to OMNI, as this might conflict with drums.


<br><br><h3>Hints</h3>

<ul>
<li>The following effect patches are not used by any standard single, multi, or drum patch:  3, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 21, 22, 23, 28

<p><li>In all standard effect patches, Submix H is always "off".  
</ul>


<br><br><h3>Gotchas</h3>

<ul>
<li>There's a bug in the Kawai K4 Sysex documentation which I have not yet resolved.  If you change the PAN value of a submix, you'll notice it goes from -7 to +7, then "??", then I1 to I6.  The "??" reflects a value which should not exist.  I do not have a K4r, and so cannot determine the proper setting of this value.

<p><li>When you update a parameter, it's not reflected on the K4's LCD until you move to something else and back again.
</ul>
