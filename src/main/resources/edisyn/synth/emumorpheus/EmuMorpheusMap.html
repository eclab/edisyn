<h1>E-Mu Morpheus and Ultra Proteus</h1>
<h2>MidiMap Patch Editor</h2>

<p>This editor will work with the <b>E-Mu Morpheus</b> and the <b>E-Mu Ultra Proteus</b>.

<br><br><h3>Communicating with Edisyn</h3>

Set the MIDI ID to the same you'll be setting in Edisyn (typically 0).  Feel free to reduce the Sysex packet delay to 0.  <b>Make certain that the MidiMap button is pressed</b>. 

<br><br><h3>Uploading a Proteus Patch</h3>

It's easy: just use Edisyn's E-Mu Proteus editor.  Be sure to first turn ON the "Proteus Sysex" option in your unit.

<br><br><h3>Gotchas</h3>

<ul>
<li>Neither the Morpheus nor the Ultra Proteus can send to the current patch -- they can only write patches, or send individual parameters.  But sending to the current patch is a critical function.  So sending will always directly write.

<p><li>You cannot request the current patch on the Morpheus or Ultra Proteus.

</ul>

<p>Thanks to Mike Perkowitz (mike@perkowitz.net) and MatrixSynth (matrixsynth@gmail.com) for their crucial help in developing and debugging this patch editor.
