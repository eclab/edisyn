I've been asked where my Patreon page is.  So, sure, here's my <a href="https://www.patreon.com/SeanLuke">Patreon page</a>.


## About

Edisyn is a synthesizer patch editor library written in pure Java.   It runs on OS X, Linux, and Windows.  

Edisyn presently supports:

* Waldorf Blofeld and Waldorf Blofeld Keyboard (Single and Multi Modes)
* Waldorf Microwave II, XT, and XTk (Single and Multi Modes)
* Oberheim Matrix 1000
* PreenFM2
* Kawai K1, Kawai K1m, and Kawai K1r (Single and Multi Modes)
* Kawai K4 and Kawai K4r (Single, Multi, Drum, and Effect Modes)
* Kawai K5 and K5m
* Yamaha DX7 Family (Single)
* Yamaha TX81Z (Single and Multi Modes)
* Korg SG Rack (Single and Multi Modes) and Korg SG Pro X (Single Mode)
* Korg Microsampler
* Korg MicroKorg
* Korg Wavestation SR (Performance, Patch, and Wave Sequence Modes)

Edisyn has infinite levels of undo, CC and NRPN mapping and learning, offline modes, extensive parameter space exploration tools (randomization/merging/nudging/hill-climbing) with per-parameter customization, real-time parameter updates, test notes, etc.

## Manual

Edisyn has an [extensive manual](https://github.com/eclab/edisyn/raw/master/docs/manual/Edisyn.pdf) which describes how to run it, and (if you are so inclined) how to make new patch editors.

## Install and Run Edisyn

Edisyn is cross-platform and will run on a variety of platforms (Windows, Linux) but I am personally developing on and for OS X.  I'd appreciate feedback and screenshots of it running on Windows and Linux so I can tweak things.


### Installation and Running on OS X 

First install Edisyn from the [Edisyn.app.zip](https://github.com/eclab/edisyn/raw/master/install/Edisyn.app.zip) file located in the "install" directory.  Sadly, it's a whopping 70MB because it includes the Java VM.  :-(


Sierra has really locked down the ability to run an application that's not from a commercial, paying Apple Developer.  And I'm not one.  So you will have to instruct Sierra to permit Edisyn to run.

Let's assume you stuck Edisyn in the /Applications directory as usual.  Then:

1. Run the Terminal Program (in /Applications/Utilities/)
2. Type the following command and hit RETURN: `   sudo spctl --add /Applications/Edisyn.app`
4. Enter your password and hit RETURN.
5. Quit the Terminal Program

Now you should be able to run Edisyn.  Let me know if this all works.


### Installation and Running on Windows

I believe that the following should work:

1. [Download and install Java 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html).  The JRE should work fine.

2. Download Edisyn's jar file, called [edisyn.jar](https://github.com/eclab/edisyn/raw/master/jar/edisyn.jar), presently located in the "jar" directory.

3. Double-click on edisyn.jar to launch Edisyn.

#### Note

Edisyn makes heavy use of Java preferences to store persistence information: what menu option you chose last time, what should be the default synth editor to pop up, and so on.  However there is a longstanding Java/Windows bug which makes Java preferences not work out of the box in Windows.  You might get a bunch of complaints from the system, but Edisyn will work: it just won't have anything persistent.

I'll try to get some information about how to get Java preferences working.  Rumor has it that this will be fixed anyway in Java 9.

### Installation and Running on Linux

I'm told that Edisyn works fine if you have installed *Java 8*.  After this:

1. Download [Edisyn's jar file](https://github.com/eclab/edisyn/raw/master/jar/edisyn.jar) located in the "jar" directory.

2. You'll need to figure out how to make it so that double-clicking on the jar file launches it in java.  In Ubuntu, here's what you do: right-click on the jar file icon and choose "Properties".  Then select the "Open With" tab, and select your Java VM (for example "Open JDK Java 8 Runtime").  The press "Set as Default".  This makes the Java VM the default application to launch jar files.

3. Thereafter you should be able to just double-click on the file to launch Edisyn.


### Running from the command line (OS X, Windows, Linux)

1. Make sure Java is installed.

2. Download [Edisyn's jar file](https://github.com/eclab/edisyn/raw/master/jar/edisyn.jar) located in the "jar" directory.

3. Run Edisyn as:   `java -jar edisyn.jar`

### Setting up midi loopback to control other programs

In order to get edisyn to talk to other programs that need midi on linux, you'll need to set up some midi loopback devices. 

In most flavors of Linux, you just need to do `sudo modprobe snd-virmidi`, but if you're using something like Gentoo or any other distro that does not come with this kernel module, you'll need to custom compile your kernel to get it. 

This will create a bunch of virtual devices with names like `VirMIDI [hw:2,0,0]` and `VirMIDI [hw:2,1,8]`. Set Edisyn to receive from one of the major channels (`VirMIDI [hw:<x>,0,0]` or `VirMIDI [hw:<x>,1,0]`, not `VirMIDI [hw:<x>,1,1]`) and send to a different major channel, then configure the other piece of software to listen on the same device that you told Edisyn to send to. If all goes well, you should be able to play a test note in edisyn and hear the software respond.
