<h1>Korg MicroKorg</h1> 
<h2>Patch Editor</h2>

<p>This editor will work with the <b>Korg MicroKorg</b>.  It probably won't work with the MS2000 family, though with some elbow grease a derivative of it should be easily made to work with them.

<br><br><h3>Communicating with Edisyn</h3>

Set WRITE PROTECT to OFF. Set the MIDI FILTER "System Exclusive" setting to ENABLE (E-E).  Set the MIDI FILTER "Program Change" setting to ENABLE (P-E).

<br><br><h3>Hints</h3>

<ul>
<li>Looking for both Timbres?  Under the <b>General</b> category, set <b>Voice Mode</b> to <b>Layer (Timbre 1 + Timbre 2).</b>  Then both timbres will show up as tabs.
</ul>

<br><br><h3>Gotchas</h3>

<ul>
<li>
The MicroKorg neither sends nor receives individual parameters over sysex.  Only a limited number of items is transmitted over CC or NRPN, so Edisyn doesn't implement them to avoid confusion.  You'll have to send your patch to see how the changes you made sound.
</ul>
