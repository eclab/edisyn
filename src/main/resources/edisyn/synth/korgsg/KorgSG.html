<h1>Korg SG</h1> 
<h2>Single Patch Editor</h2>

<p>This editor will work with the <b>Korg SG Rack</b> and the <b>Korg SG Pro X</b>.

<p>Note that though this editor will work with the Pro X, the [Multi] version of this patch editor will not: it only works with the Rack.

<br><br><h3>Communicating with Edisyn</h3>

Set your SG to have sysex enabled ("MIDI Exclusive: ENA").

<br><br><h3>Hints</h3>

<ul>
<li>Edisyn can set the Depth of various effects individually ("left" or "right") -- you can't do this from the SG's front panel.  You can set both left and right at the same time: just shift-drag (or right-mouse-button-drag, or click with two fingers and drag on the Mac) one of the two Depth dials, and the other will change as well.  This also goes for the Stereo Delay's Delay Time (left and right).
</ul>

<br><br><h3>Gotchas</h3>

<ul>
<li>
The SG doesn't receive individual parameter changes: you'll have to make changes, then send or write the patch.

<p><li>The Hyper Enhancer effect type is only available for Effect 1, and its left and right Depth is only "Dry" or "Wet" (nothing in-between).

<p>The SG has some odd character options in its names.  Instead of \, ~, and DEL (ASCI characters 92, 126, and 127 respectively), the SG displays a Yen symbol, left arrow, and right arrow respectively.
</ul>
