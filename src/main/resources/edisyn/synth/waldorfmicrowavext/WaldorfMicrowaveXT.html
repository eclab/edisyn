<h1>Waldorf Microwave II / XT / XTk</h1> 
<h2>Single Patch Editor</h2>

<p>This editor will work with the <b>Waldorf Microwave II,</b> the <b>Waldorf Microwave XT,</b> and the <b>Waldorf Microwave XTk</b> in 10 voice or in 30 voice.

<br><br><h3>Communicating with Edisyn</h3>

Set your Microwave to send <b>Sysex only</b>, not <b>Ctl</b> nor <b>Ctl+Sysex.</b>  Also set <b>Receive</b> to on.

<br><br><h3>XT/XTk Options</h3>

Some options are only available for the Microwave XT and Microwave XTk:

<ul>
<li><b>External Option</b><br> (In the Mixer) lets you specify how much the external audio input is mixed into the device.
<p><li><b>Additional Effects</b> The <b>Delay,</b> <b>Pan Delay,</b> and <b>Mod Delay</b> effects are only available on the XT and XTk.
</ul>

<br><br><h3>About the Arpeggiator Patterns</h3>

The arpeggiator pattern display can be a bit confusing.  You can set the arpeggiator to <b>OFF</b>, to a <b>USER PATTERN</b>, or to one of 15 DEFAULT PATTERNS.  The <b>checkboxes</b> always represent what the user pattern is set to (even if you're not using it).  The <b>red borders</b> represent the default pattern you've set (if any).

<p>You may be wondering why all or some of the checkboxes are off.  To change this, first set the <b>Pattern</b> knob to "User", and then set the <b>User Length</b> knob to the desired pattern length.

<br><br><h3>Gotchas</h3>

<ul>
<li>If you randomize or hill-climb a patch, the wavetable will never change to any of the User wavetables.  This was done on purpose because often these wavetables are blank.

<p><li>If you load the current patch, the Microwave does not tell Edisyn what bank or number the patch is.

<p><li>The Microwave does not respond to nor does it send parameter changes for effect type.  So changing it on the machine will not update Edisyn, and changing it in Edisyn will not update the machine (until you send or receive a patch).

<p><li>Changing any parameter doesn't update the "edited" flag (the little 'e' next to the patch name) on the screen.

<p><li> Changing the arpeggiation triggers in Edisyn doesn't update them on the Microwave's screen, though they're updated in memory internally.  Similarly, changing the name in Edisyn doesn't update the name in the name edit screen, though it's changed internally.

<p><li> The Overdrive Effect's Amp Drive parameter is weirdly biased towards "Stack" due to how it's encoded in Waldorf's sysex. 
</ul>

<br><br><h3>Fun Feature</h3>

When your patch editor becomes the front window, it'll ask the Microwave to change to Single mode automatically.
