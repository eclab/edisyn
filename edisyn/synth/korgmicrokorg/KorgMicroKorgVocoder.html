<h1>Korg MicroKorg</h1> 
<h2>Vocoder Patch Editor</h2>

<p>This editor will work with the <b>Korg MicroKorg</b>.  It probably won't work with the MS2000 family, though with some elbow grease a derivative of it should be easily made to work with them.

<p><b>Communicating with Edisyn</b> Set WRITE PROTECT to OFF, and set the MIDI FILTER "System Exclusive" setting to ENABLE (E-E).

<p><b>Hints</b>
<ul>
<li>Confused by how the Hold Levels text fields work?  It's easy.  If you type a new number in the field, it turns bright red to indicate that the number has been typed but not yet entered into Edisyn.  Simply press RETURN or TAB, or click on another text field, or click on another tab, and it'll get automatically entered.  You can cancel what you typed by pressing ESCAPE.
</ul>

<p><b>Gotchas</b>

<ul>
<li>
The MicroKorg neither sends nor receives individual parameters over sysex.  Only a limited number of items is transmitted over CC or NRPN, so Edisyn doesn't implement them to avoid confusion.  You'll have to send your patch to see how the changes you made sound.
</ul>
