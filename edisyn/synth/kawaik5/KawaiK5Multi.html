<h1>Kawai K5</h1> 
<h2>Multimode Patch Editor</h2>

<p><font color=red>Warning:</font> This patch editor is untested and likely may exhibit some errors.  I no longer have a K5 and so cannot verify it.  Please let me know what you find.

<p>This editor will work with the <b>Kawai K5</b> and <b>Kawai K5m</b>.

<p><b>Communicating with Edisyn</b><br> Turn of memory protect.  Set your K5 to transmit and receive &lt;SYSTEM&gt; MIDI on the same channel as you've set up Edisyn (perhaps channel 1?), and likewise to transmit and receive &lt;EXCLUSIVE&gt; MIDI on that same channel.

<p><b>About Patch MID-12</b><br> The Kawai K5 has no sysex command which would enable Edisyn to send a patch to its temporary memory.  However this is important to enable merging, nudging, hill-climbing, randomization, etc.  One way to get around this is to send individual parameters one by one.  However the K5 has a great deal of parameters, so this approach is simply too slow.  

<p>So instead of sending a patch to temporary memory, Edisyn <b>writes</b> the patch to patch number MID-12 (the very last one).  This will erase and overwrite this patch and basically treat it as a scratch area.
