<h1>Roland JV-80 / JV-880</h1> 
<h2>Single Patch Editor</h2>

<p>This patch editor ought to work properly with both the JV-80 and the JV-880.  However it has only been tested with the JV-880. Please let me know of any discrepancies you discover.

<br><br><h3>Communicating with Edisyn</h3>

When you set up MIDI in the patch editor, you can specify the MIDI channel and the Synth ID.  Set your synthesizer's Patch Receive channel ("Rx channel") to the same as Edisyn's channel (perhaps Channel 1), and its "Unit number" to the same as Edisyn's Synth ID (perhaps 17).  Set Program Change, Bank Select, and Exclusive to ON.   Finally, make sure the Patch/Performance button is set to PATCH, and the Edit button is OFF (these two are important, else your JV won't respond properly).
