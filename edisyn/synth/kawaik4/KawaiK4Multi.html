<h1>Kawai K4</h1> 
<h2>Multi-Mode Patch Editor</h2>

<p>This editor will work with the <b>Kawai K4</b> and the <b>Kawai K4r</b>.

<p><b>Communicating with Edisyn</b> Set your K4 to receive Program Changes (RCV PGM = NORM) and Exclusive (RCV EXCL = ON).  See pages 79 and 80 of the manual.  You'll also probably want your send channel and receive channel to be the same.  I wouldn't set the receive channel to OMNI, as this might conflict with drums.

<p><b>Bank Sysex</b> This patch editor knows about bank sysex messages (which group together multiple patches) as well as single-patch sysex messages.  If Edisyn loads or receives a bank sysex message, you will be given the option to edit a patch from it, to save the whole bank sysex, or to upload the whole bank sysex.

<p><b>All Patch Sysex</b>If Edisyn receives an all-patch sysex message (representing the whole memory of the synthesizer) it cannot select from it messages for this patch editor.  It will select messages for the K4 (Single) editor instead.

<p><b>Hints</b>
<ul>
<li>The following effect patches are not used by any standard single, multi, or drum patch:  3, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 21, 22, 23, 28

<p><li>In all standard effect patches, Submix H is always "off".  
</ul>

<p><b>Gotchas</b>

<ul>
<li>
You can't make parameter changes in real-time.

<p><li>When you send a patch, the name isn't updated: but the sound has in fact been changed.

</ul>
