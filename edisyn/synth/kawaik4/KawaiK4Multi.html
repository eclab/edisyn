<h1>Kawai K4</h1> 
<h2>Multi-Mode Patch Editor</h2>

<p>This editor will work with the <b>Kawai K4</b> and the <b>Kawai K4r</b>.

<br><br><h3>Communicating with Edisyn</h3>

Set your K4 to receive Program Changes (RCV PGM = NORM) and Exclusive (RCV EXCL = ON).  See pages 79 and 80 of the manual.  You'll also probably want your send channel and receive channel to be the same.  I wouldn't set the receive channel to OMNI, as this might conflict with drums.

<br><br><h3>K4 Banks</h3>

You'd think that the "A, B, C, D" buttons on the K4 designate four banks.  But they don't.  For purposes of sysex (and for Edisyn's purposes) the K4 only has two banks: internal and external, each with 64 patches.  Edisyn designates the "A, B, C, D" as so-called <b>groups</b>.


<br><br><h3>All Patch Sysex</h3>

If Edisyn receives an all-patch sysex message (representing the whole memory of the synthesizer) it cannot select from it messages for this patch editor.  It will select messages for the K4 (Single) editor instead.

<br><br><h3>Hints</h3>

<ul>
<li>The following effect patches are not used by any standard single, multi, or drum patch:  3, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 21, 22, 23, 28

<p><li>In all standard effect patches, Submix H is always "off".  
</ul>

<br><br><h3>Gotchas</h3>

<ul>
<li>
You can't make parameter changes in real-time.

<p><li>When you send a patch, the name isn't updated: but the sound has in fact been changed.

</ul>

<br><br><h3>Thanks</h3>
