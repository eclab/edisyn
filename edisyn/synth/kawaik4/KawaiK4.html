<h1>Kawai K4</h1> 
<h2>Single Patch Editor</h2>

<p>This editor will work with the <b>Kawai K4</b> and the <b>Kawai K4r</b>.

<br><br><h3>Communicating with Edisyn</h3>

Set your K4 to receive Program Changes (RCV PGM = NORM) and Exclusive (RCV EXCL = ON).  See pages 79 and 80 of the manual.  You'll also probably want your send channel and receive channel to be the same.  I wouldn't set the receive channel to OMNI, as this might conflict with drums.

<br><br><h3>Bank Sysex</h3>

This patch editor knows about bank sysex messages (which group together multiple patches) as well as single-patch sysex messages.  If Edisyn loads or receives a bank sysex message, you will be given the option to edit a patch from it, to save the whole bank sysex, or to upload the whole bank sysex.

<br><br><h3>Hints</h3>

<ul>
<li>The following effect patches are not used by any standard single, multi, or drum patch:  3, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 21, 22, 23, 28
<p><li>In all standard effect patches, Submix H is always "off".
<p><li>The K4's documentation regarding filter envelopes is wrong.  A filter envelope's strength is multiplied by the envelope depth, and then the whole thing is added to the primary filter cutoff.  A filter envelope starts at 0, rises to maximum attack, then decays to the sustain level (which can be above or below 0!), then finally releases back to 0.   This means that the cutoff starts at the base cutoff value, then rises to some higher value, decays to a sustain possibly <i>below</i> the base cutoff value, then returns the base cutoff on release.  Furthermore, the envelope depth can be inverted, so attacks can go down rather than up.
</ul>


<br><br><h3>Gotchas</h3>

<ul>
<li><b><color=red>New in v24</b>You can't send mute as a simple parameter change.  As a result, Edisyn will do a full send to current patch when you change mute.  This is a different behavior than in past versions, where Edisyn used to turn down the volume on a mute.

<p><li>When you update a parameter, it's not reflected on the K4's LCD until you move to something else and back again.  Also when you send a patch, the name isn't updated: but the sound has in fact been changed.

<p><li>When in Normal or Twin, resonance only goes 0...3.
</ul>
