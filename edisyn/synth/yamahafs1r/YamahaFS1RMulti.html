<h1>Yamaha FS1R</h1> 
<h2>Performance Patch Editor</h2>

This editor handles performances, not voices.  Though FS1R performances and voices are meant to work hand-in-hand, Edisyn's voice and performance editors are separate; but they can work together in certain ways as discussed below.

<br><br><h3>Communicating with Edisyn</h3>
Set the FS1R to receive System Exclusive, Bulk Dumps, Bank Selection, and Program Change.  That is, set Rcv SysExcl, RcvBulkDump, Rcv BankSel, and Rcv PgmChng to ON.  Set the Program Change Mode to "Multi".  Set the FS1R's Device Number to either ALL or to the Synth ID in Edisyn's MIDI panel.  For most MIDI devices, you can probably reduce the FS1R's Dump Interval to 50ms.  Set Edisyn's send and receive MIDI channels to the FS1R's receive and send channels respectively. 

<br><br><h3>About the FS1R Menu</h3>

The menu has several options which hopefully make working with the patch editor more useful:

<ul>
<li><b>Mute Parts...</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This lets you temporarily mute parts of your choice, notionally so you can focus on hearing certain other parts.  "Muting" mean that Edisyn will send the FS1R a command to set their MIDI channel to OFF.  The actual parameter setting in Edisyn will be unaffected.  If an operator is unmuted, the MIDI channel will be restored.  Note that this only applies to immediate real-time changes: requesting a patch, writing a patch, or sending it, may reset the Mute settings.  

<p><li><b>Swap Parts...</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This lets you swap two parts.  Note that the Fseq Part (See Common tab) is unchanged, so if it was referring to one of the parts it's now referring to the other.  Similarly, the Voice Control Set part values are not swapped.

<p><li><b>Copy Part To...</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This lets you copy a part to another (or to all of them).  You can of course also do this with Edisyn's copy tab menu.

</ul>

<br><br><h3>Loading DX7 Patches</h3>

It's easy: just use the DX7 Editor.

<br><br><h3>Hints</h3>
<ul>
<li>If you press "Show", the voice patch associated with the current Part will be displayed.
</ul>


<br><br><h3>Gotchas</h3>
<ul>
<li>Changing patches or loading a patch takes a <b>very long amount of time</b>, during which the FS1R will be unresponsive to requests to play notes etc.  You will find this annoying.

<li>Because loading a patch takes a long time (just under 3 seconds) batch-downl
oading patches from the unit can take much longer than you'd expect.

<p><li>If a Part is set to mono (not poly), and you change the voice's Algorithm while playing a note, the FS1R will hang and stop making sound.  You can bring the synth back to life by requesting the current patch again, or sending All Sounds Off.  
</ul>

<br><br><h3>Librarian Support</h3>

The FS1R uploads and downloads quite slowly, and also has a very large buffer.This means that using the librarian is at present a somewhat painful experience -- it's very slow to interact with the machine.

<br><br><h3>Thanks</h3>
Thanks to K_Take (k_take@dual.squares.net) for giving me access to the source code of FS1REditor and permission to reuse many of its embedded tables, without which Edisyn's patch editor would not have been possible.  And thanks to Thor Zollinger (thor276@cableone.net) for his tutoring on the internal operation of the FS1R.  Thanks to Jeremy Bernstein (jeremy@cycling74.com) for his help in debugging.
