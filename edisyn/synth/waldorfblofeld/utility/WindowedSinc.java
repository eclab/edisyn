    /** Given an array of (sound) SAMPLES sampled at a CURRENT SAMPLING RATE, returns a new array of samples resampled from the original array
        at a NEW SAMPLING RATE.  The quality of the resampling -- and also the degree to which aliasing is minimized -- is determined by 
        the WINDOW SIZE, which should be an odd number, normally significantly smaller than the number of SAMPLES.  A window size of 17 would
        be a good pick if you had to select something.  Larger window sizes will increase the interpolation time linearly.  The samples in 
        question might be a LOOP of samples or just a single one-shot array.
