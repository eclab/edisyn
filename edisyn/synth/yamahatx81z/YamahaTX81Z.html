<h1>Yamaha TX81Z</h1> 
<h2>Single Patch Editor</h2>

<p><b>Communicating with Edisyn</b> Set your TX81Z's receive and transmit channel to the same thing (perhaps Channel 1).  Set the program change to be <b>Com</b> (Common).  Make sure that Sysex is turned <b>on</b>.

<p><b>About the Menu</b> If you mutate or recombine patches (using randomize, merge, hill-climb, or nudge) it may result in unfortunate operator frequency results. The Restrict Mutated Frequency Ratios... menu lets you restrict mutation or recombination of operator frequecies so that they only result in integer values or only to coarse-tune settings (either way, no fine tune).  I suggest integers.  I strongly suggest you also edit the mutation parameters to remove Fixed Frequency, Detune, and Frequency Ratio Fine from every operator, and also Transpose from the global settings.

<p><b>Gotchas</b>

<ul>
<li>
The TX81Z doesn't have a way to send or write patches from sysex.  Though Edisyn could manipulate its front buttons via sysex in order to write patches, it's a little dangerous.  So Edisyn doesn't provide it as an option.  To write a patch you have to send to the current patch from Edisyn, then manually save it to your desired patch from the front panel.
<p><li>Similarly, changing patches is challenging: it requires a bit of manipulation of the front panel using the TX81Z's unusual "press buttons for me" sysex options.  It should work in general, but if strange things happen, let me know.
<p><li>The TX81Z is very unusual in that its patches aren't updated by a sysex bulk data command, but by <b>two of them in sequence</b>.  This is a backwards-compatibility thing with earlier 4-op synthesizers.  Thus when you save a patch to a file in Edisyn, you'll actually be saving <b>two</b> sysex commands concatenated together.  You should be aware of this in case you try sending it from librarian software and it doesn't like it (it shouldn't be a problem).
