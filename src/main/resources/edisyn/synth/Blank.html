<h1>Put Your Synthesizer Name Here (like Yamaha TX81Z)</h1> 
<h2>Single [or Multi] Patch Editor</h2>

<p>Here you want to tell the user exactly which kinds of synthesizers your patch will work with,
and other interesting top-level information.

<p><b>Communicating with Edisyn</b><br> 
Here you should provide instructions as to how to set up the synthesizer (to only send sysex, or whatever)
so it works properly with Edisyn.

<p><b>Other Interesting Facts</b><br>
You might add some other sections regarding unusual features of your
patch editor.  For example, the PreenFM2 has a section called <b>About the Algorithm Diagrams</b>
which explains how the diagram icons are to be interpreted.  Some synthesizers also have a section
called <b>Fun Feature</b> which describe some unusual fun feature that the patch editor supports.

<p><b>Gotchas</b><br>
Most of the synthesizers have a section called <b>Gotchas</b> which describes, in bullet-list form,
the various missing features, problems, or difficulties you may encounter when dealing with this kind
of synthesizer: perhaps you can't send to current patch; or perhaps it's not possible to merge; and so
on.

<p><li>Here's the third gotcha.  And so on.
