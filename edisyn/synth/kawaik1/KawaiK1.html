<h1>Kawai K1</h1> 
<h2>Single Patch Editor</h2>

<p>This editor will work with the <b>Kawai K1</b>, the <b>Kawai K1m</b>, and the <b>Kawai K1r</b>.

<p><b>Communicating with Edisyn</b> Turn of INT PROTECT and CARD PROTECT.  Set your K1 to receive Program Changes (set RCV PGM to NORM) and Exclusive (RCV EXCL).  See pages 38, 41, and 42 of the manual.  You'll also probably want your send channel and receive channel to be the same. 

<p><b>Bank Sysex</b> This patch editor knows about bank sysex messages (which group together multiple patches) as well as single-patch sysex messages.  If Edisyn loads or receives a bank sysex message, you will be given the option to edit a patch from it, to save the whole bank sysex, or to upload the whole bank sysex.

<p><b>About the Menu</b> The Kawai K1 has no sysex command which would enable Edisyn to send a patch to its temporary memory.  However this is important to enable merging, nudging, hill-climbing, randomization, etc.  One way to get around this is to send individual parameters one by one.  However the K1 needs about 50ms after each and every parameter change.As a result, this approach (the menu option <b>"Send Parameters: Individually"</b>) takes several seconds, which is unacceptably slow for many things, particularly hill-climbing.

<p>Edisyn offers an alternative: instead of sending a patch to temporary memory, you can <b>write</b> the patch to patch number iD-8 (the very last one) or eD-8 (if you're working on the external card).  This will erase and overwrite this patch and basically treat it as a scratch area: but it's fairly fast.  You can choose this option (and I suggest you do) with <b>"Send Parameters: In Bulk, Overwriting Patch iD-8"</b>.  You might want to back up that patch first.  If you messed up, or you need to restore iD-8 ("Rim+Snare"), you can find it in Edisyn's source distribution, under the Resources directory. 

<p><b>Gotchas</b>

<ul>
<li>The Kawai K1's sysex is <b>slow</b>: individual parameter changes can only occur once every 50ms.  Indeed Edisyn's patch editor has been set up so that every single MIDI event takes 50ms just in case.  See the discussion about menu options above.

<p><li>Because the K1 has no easy way to send patches to temporary working memory (see menu options above), the <b>Send to Patch...</b> option has been disabled.

<p><li>
You can't set mute as a parameter change.  So when you set mute, Edisyn will just tell the synth to turn the volume (VCA Envelope Level) to 0 for that source.  Further, if you write a patch with mute set, Edisyn will write the patch with the mute unset, but zero the volume.  

<p><p>This strategy works fine if your patch didn't have mute already set on the synth when you loaded it into Edisyn.  But if mute is set on the synth, then Edisyn can't do anything about when you change the mute value: it'll still be muted on the synth until you send or write the patch.  Long story short: when loading a patch, make sure it's entirely unmuted to avoid confusion.

<p><li>When you update a parameter, it's not reflected on the K1's LCD until you move to something else and back again.  Also when you send a patch, the name isn't updated: but the sound has in fact been changed.
