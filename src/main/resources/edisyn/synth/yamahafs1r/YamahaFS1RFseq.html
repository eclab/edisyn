<h1>Yamaha FS1R</h1> 
<h2>Fseq Patch Editor</h2>

This editor handles Fseqs only.  

<br><br><h3>Communicating with Edisyn</h3>
Set the FS1R's to receive System Exclusive, Bulk Dumps, Bank Selection, and Program Change.  That is, set Rcv SysExcl, RcvBulkDump, Rcv BankSel, and Rcv PgmChng to ON.  Set the Program Change Mode to "Multi".  Set the FS1R's Device Number to either ALL or to the Synth ID in Edisyn's MIDI panel.  For most MIDI devices, you can probably reduce the FS1R's Dump Interval to 50ms.  Set Edisyn's send and receive MIDI channels to the FS1R's receive and send channels respectively. 

<p>Finally, and this one is important: if you are planning on actually writing Fseqs to internal memory, you'll need to change the FS1R's internal memory organization to 64 Voice patches and 6 Fseq slots.  To do this, under <b>Util</b>, go to <b>System</b>, then <b>Others</b>, then change <b>Mem</b> (Memory Allocation) to <b>"IntVoice64"</b>.    Note that this will <b>erase all existing internal voices and Fseqs</b>.

<b><br><h3>Using the Displays</h3>

In addition to the myriad of dials on the Common tab, this editor also displays all the voiced, unvoiced, and pitch values for every frame. The frames are divided into three overlapping displays for convenience: frames 1-256, 129-386, and 257-512.  The voiced and unvoiced operator values are all displayed in gray (you can select which operators you want to show), but only one operator can be <i>edited</i> at a time: that operator is shown in red.

<p>There are two displays each for the voiced and unvoiced operators; the larger upper displays show frequency in Hertz, and the lower ones show level.  

<b><br><h3>About the Menu</h3>

The FS1R menu contains a number of utilities which will hopefully make editing a bit easier.

<ul>
<li><b>Show Current Performance</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Loads the current FS1R Performance in an editor.
<p><li><b>Show Current Part 1</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Loads the voice associated with the current performance's Part 1 in an editor.
<p><li><b>Set Up Test Performance and Part 1</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Creates a default FS1R Performance and Voice suitable for testing your Fseq.  The performance has a single Voice in Part 1, chosen from among 14 built-in voices in the FS1R designed for Fseqs.
<p><li><b>Swap Tracks...</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Swaps two different tracks.  You can restrict the range of Frames in which this operation occurs.
<p><li><b>Copy Track To...</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Copies a track to another track, or to all other tracks. You can restrict the range of Frames in which this operation occurs.
<!--
<p><li><b>Clear Track...</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sets all the values of a track to 0.  You can restrict the range of Frames in which this operation occurs.
-->
<p><li><b>Cut Frames...</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Cuts out a range of frames and places them on a gaobal clipboard.  Note that you can paste these frames back into this editor or into a <b>different editor</b>.
<p><li><b>Copy Frames...</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Copies a range of frames to a global clipboard.  Note that you can paste these frames back into this editor or into a <b>different editor</b>.
<p><li><b>Paste Frames...</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Inserts the frames from the global clipboard at the provided insertion point.  
<p><li><b>Overwrite Frames...</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Directly overwrites frames at the provided point with the frames stored in the global clipboard.  You can restrict what is overwritten to be certain tracks, voiced/unvoiced only, or including pitch information.
<p><li><b>Clear Frames...</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sets a range of frames to zero.  You can restrict which parameters are erased, including the track, voiced/unvoiced only, or pitch.
<!--
<p><li><b>Duplicate Frame</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Copies the value of a single frames, overwriting a range of other frames.  You can restrict what is overwritten to be certain tracks, voiced/unvoiced only, or including pitch information.  This might be useful, for example, for setting all frames to a given pitch.
-->
<p><li><b>Distribute Frame</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Copies the values of a given frame to a range other frames.
<p><li><b>NormalizeFrames</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Normalizes the levels of a range of frames.
<p><li><b>Set Pitch...</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sets the pitch of a range of frames.
</ul>

<br><br><h3>Gotchas</h3>
<ul>

<li>These patches are big.  When Edisyn sends or writes a patch, it takes a while for the FS1R to digest it.  Edisyn sends patches all the time: when you load a patch, when you undo, when you randomize, etc.  If you do these things rapidly in sequence, the FS1R will take a long time to update; you should wait a beat between them to let the FS1R catch up.

<li>Similarly, expect a very long time to do batch downloads.

<p><li>This editor does not support real-time Fseq parameter changes.
</ul>
