<h1>Korg Wavestation SR</h1> 
<h2>Wave Sequence Editor</h2>

<p>This editor is designed work with the <b>Korg Wavestation SR</b>.  It will <b>not</b> work with any other Wavestation models (the original Wavestation, the Wavestation EX, or the Wavestation A/D).

<br><br><h3><font color="red">IMPORTANT NOTE</font></h3>

It is very important that you read this document carefully and entirely, especially the "Gotchas" section, before manipulating your SR wave sequences with this editor, or you will lose and/or corrupt data.

<br><br><h3>Bank Sysex</h3>

Wave sequences can only be loaded a whole bank at a time.  If Edisyn loads or receives a bank sysex message, you will be given the option to edit a patch from it, to save the whole bank sysex, or to upload the whole bank sysex.  Edisyn also can save and load its own proprietary single-wave-sequence sysex format.

<br><br><h3>Communicating with Edisyn</h3>

Set your SR to receive sysex parameters, and also to receive program change and bank select commands, as well as All Notes Off.  Turn off memory protect (including for your card if you need to).  Make sure that the MIDI channel set for the SR matches the one you're using in Edisyn.

<br><br><h3>Hints</h3>

<ul>
<li>Can't figure out how to access any Step beyond Step 1?  Click the "Number of Steps" button and increase the steps.  Warning: don't make this a big number (it takes a long time to make a large sequence).

<p><li>If the wave sequences are too narrow on the display, try changing the <b>Magnify</b> dial.
</ul>

<br><br><h3>The Wavestation Menu</h3>

<ul>
<li>Wave Sequences must be auditioned by playing them in a Performance holding a Patch.  If you select <b>Set up Test Performance/Patch in RAM 1 Slot 0 Wave A</b>, Edisyn will temporarily modify Performance 1:0 so that it contains a single Part, at full volume, with no effects and default settings.  The Part will be Patch 1:0, consisting of a single Wave (A).  This Wave will be your current Wave Sequence.  Just don't write the Performance or the Patch and you'll be fine.

<p><li>You can also toggle on/off the soloing of the current step by selecting <b>Toggle Solo Step</b>.  Note that the Wavestation will ignore this request unless you're currently editing a performance, patch, or wave sequence on the SR's screen.  So you might, for example, press <b>Perf</b> and then <b>Edit</b> before issuing this menu option.   Also Edisyn can't tell if you've turned on the toggle or turned it off: to do this, you have to be editing a wave sequence on the SR screen.  To do this, you might first press <b>Perf Edit Edit Page+ Edit</b>.  Then if you do the toggle, it's on if you see a blinking "S".

<p><li>Finally, if you choose <b>Block Sending Any Parameters</b>, you can prevent Edisyn from sending parameters except when writing to a patch.  This is useful (and <b><font color="red">you should have it turned on by default</font></b>) because changing parameters on wave sequences in the Wavestation is immediate and permanent.  You probably don't want that.  See Gotchas below.
</ul>


<br><br><h3>Gotchas</h3>

The Wavestation SR has a number of serious issues regarding its wave sequences.  You need to make sure you understand them.

<ul>
<li><font color="red"><b>Important. </b></font>There is no current working memory for wave sequences: any parameter changes you make will be <b>immediately permanent.</b>  Thus:

<p><ul>
<li>You should back up before using this editor on your SR.

<p><li>Unlike other patch editors, this patch editor will not send parameters upon loading from disk, as it will automatically overwrite stuff.

<p><li>Any parameter tweak, or undo/redo, or mutate, or merge, or hill-climb, or nudge, or send that you perform will be immediately written to the SR permanently.  You probably don't want that.  I suggest instead that you turn on <b>Block Sending Any Parameters</b> in the Wavestation menu until you understand the implications of what you're doing (I've messed up things too often myself).  You can still write parameters to the patch when this menu option is turned on.
</ul>

<p><li>The Wavestation cannot receive a single wave sequence: it expects to receive all wave sequences together as a huge 11Kbyte block.  This means that the normal way to send or write a sequence would be for Edisyn to load the entire block, make a change, and then write out again.  Edisyn doesn't do this.  Instead, it sends individual parameters.

<p><br>The problem is that writing out individual parameters on the SR is both slow and buggy, and particularly slow if you have a long sequence (in computer speak, building a sequence of length N takes O(N^2) time, ugh).  

<p><br>For this reason, Edisyn by default only changes the step length when writing a sequence.  This can have unforseen consequences.  For example, if you increase the step length, and then UNDO it, the step length is NOT decreased on the SR -- it stays the same, though it has changed in Edisyn (and so the two are now out of sync). 

<p><br>For similar reasons, "Send To Patch..." is disabled.

<p><li>Real-time updating individual parameters is a little pokey.  This is because Edisyn must insert a significant delay between successive parameter updates or they'll get dropped by the SR.

<p><li>Due to a Korg bug, if you try to change the name of a patch on the SR over MIDI, it gets corrupted (specifically, the first byte of the string is replaced with value 0).  So Edisyn doesn't allow you to change wave sequence names: you'll have to do it manually.  To do this, go to the wave sequence editing page (Perf, Edit, Edit, Page+, Edit), make sure you're naming the wave sequence you want to name, then press Write, edit the name, and press Write, then Yes. 

<p><li>Sometimes after a write one or more paramters will not have been written correctly.  So try playing the sequence; if it doesn't sound right, try sending again.  If the issue is common, send me email and I'll lengthen certain delays, which should lessen the problem.
