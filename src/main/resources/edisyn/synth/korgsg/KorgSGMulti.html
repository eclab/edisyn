<h1>Korg SG Rack</h1> 
<h2>Multi Patch Editor</h2>

<p>This editor will work with the <b>Korg SG Rack</b>.  It will <b>not</b> work with the <b>Korg SG Pro X</b> (or work well with it).

<br><br><h3>Communicating with Edisyn</h3>

Set your SG to have sysex enabled ("MIDI Exclusive: ENA").

<br><br><h3>Hints</h3>

<ul>
<li>Korg SG models come in roughly two versions: version numbers 1 to 7, and version 8.  If you have version 8, you have more parameter options available.  In each Timbre category, parameters available to version 8 <b>only</b> are marked with a [v8], parameters available to versions 1 to 7 <b>only</b> are marked with a [v1-7], and parameters available to both are not so marked. You tell Edisyn what version your machine is by marking the <b>Version 8</b> checkbox.
</ul>

<br><br><h3>Gotchas</h3>

<ul>
<li>
The SG doesn't receive individual parameter changes: you'll have to make changes, then send or write the patch.
</ul>
