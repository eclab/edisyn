<h1>Roland D-110</h1> 
<h2>Multi Patch Editor</h2>

<p>This patch editor is designed for the D-110.  It will not work properly with the D-10.

<br><br><h3>Communicating with Edisyn</h3>

Set the synth ID to the same as your synthesizer (17 is customary).  Make certain that Memory Protect is OFF and (this is very important) that Overflow is OFF.  Earlier ROMs have a bug which causes sysex dumps to fail if Overflow is not OFF.  Note that you may have to Memory Protect to OFF every time you turn on the synthesizer.  

<p>Set Edisyn's channel to your D-110's Control Channel (1 is customary), or else you'll be able to download patches but not change them on the D-110, which would be confusing. You'll want the Control Channel different from the individual part channels (which normally start at 2).  Note that if you view the current Multi patch from the Tone patch menu, its channel will be set to the Tone patch's channel: you'll need to change the channel.  See <b>About the Menu</b> below for more on the implications of setting the Control Channel. 


<br><br><h3>Real-Time Parameter Bugs</h3>

I have received a report that sending real-time parameter changes can crash the D-110.  The configuration was a 1.06 ROM, Windows, and a Midiplus Tbox 2X2 adapter.  I have had no problems at all: I am using a 1.10 ROM, MacOS, Tascam 2x2 adapter.  I suspect the issue is the older ROM. If you experience this problem, you can uncheck the <b>Sends Real Time Changes</b> menu.  Please report any problems you have experienced.

<br><br><h3>About the Menu</h3>

Edisyn must have its output channel set to the same as the D-110 Control Channel or else you can't change patches.  But this inconvenient if you want to hear instruments on various parts.  To get around this, Edisyn lets you stipulate that test notes should be played through the channel specified by a selected part.  If this channel is "OFF", or if you have selected the Default Channel in the menu, then Edisyn will use the standard output channel again.  Beware that if you change the part's channel while playing a test note, the note could get stuck as its NOTE OFF got sent to the wrong channel.  In this case, just select Send All Sounds Off.


<br><br><h3>Gotchas</h3>

<ul>
<li>The Roland-D110 doesn't have the concept of a single-mode patch: it <i>only</i> has multimode patches, which it simply calls "Patches".  I have opted to call this <b>Roland D-110 [Multi]</b> rather than <b>Roland D-110 [Patch]</b> to stay consistent with other Edisyn synthesizers.
<p><li>If you've used the D-110 long enough to figure out its bizarre structure, you probably know by now that the notion of a Timbre is completely useless.  It's a holdover from the Roland D-10 structure, where it made more sense.  Although you can save and load Timbres to RAM, Patches do not actually store references to Timbres: they store references to Tones.  Thus this patch editor provides no facilities for Timbres at all, just Patch editing.
<p><li>You will find that if you grab lots of Partials for a given Part in the Partial Reserve section, others will be reduced: you can only have 32 partials total.
<p><li>There is to my knowledge no way to specify loading from a Card versus Internal memory.  Instead, if a Multimode patch is on a card, it refers to tones also on that card.  Edisyn has no control over Cards versus Internal memory at all: you have to manually copy patches from a card to internal memory on the D-110 directly.
<p><li>Obviously there are more global Rhythm options, such as Pan.  But for some crazy reason they're not stored as part of Patches in memory.
</ul>
